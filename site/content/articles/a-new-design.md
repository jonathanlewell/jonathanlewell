## Why Hugo?

I've used WordPress for nearly 10 years now. But to be honest... Seeing that my old site took 4 seconds to load caused me to seriously doubt my development abilities. And I was right - I had relied on page-builders, which are great for quickly whipping up an opt-in page, but lackluster in the speed department. 

These past few months I've been grappling with learning HTML, CSS and Hugo. Hugo is a static site generator. You plug in markdown and HTML, and it spits out HTML. It's free.

Since you're dealing with pure HTML, you're also not going to get bogged down by plugins, incomphrenesible PHP shit, and all of the rest of it.

I'll write more on Hugo soon.
